# SWARM React Native Guidelines

## Development Requirements:
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

## Initialize a new project
we create a creator.sh to help creating and setting a new react-native project. 
Use this command to initialize a new project.
``` bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swarmnyc/SWARM-Project-Guidelines/master/react-native/creator.sh)"
```

``` bash
# use react native CLI to create a new project with typescript
npx react-native init <ProjectName> --template typescript
cd <ProjectName>

# create folders and move default files
mkdir app app/src app/src/scenes app/src/services app/src/models app/src/utils app/res/ app/res/images app/res/fonts
mv __tests__ app
mv App.tsx app/src ## need to change the path of import App on index.js

# download the files for editors like VS code
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swarmnyc/SWARM-Project-Guidelines/master/react-native/.editorconfig
```
